### Overview
Facial recognition is a computer vision technique that can be used to identify or verify a person from a digital image or video. It is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of purposes, such as security, access control, and marketing.

In this README, we will walk you through the steps of building a facial recognition system using OpenCV, data augmentation, and the ResNet VGG16 model.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
OpenCV 4.0+
NumPy
Keras

### Data
The first step is to collect a dataset of images of the people you want to be able to identify. The images should be well-lit and in focus, and the person's face should be clearly visible.

Once you have collected your dataset, you need to split it into two sets: a training set and a test set. The training set will be used to train the model, and the test set will be used to evaluate the model's performance.

### Data Augmentation
Data augmentation is a technique that can be used to increase the size of your dataset. This is important because it helps to prevent the model from overfitting to the training data.

There are a variety of data augmentation techniques that can be used for facial recognition. One common technique is to crop and resize the images. This helps to ensure that the model is able to recognize faces from different angles and sizes.

Another common technique is to add noise to the images. This helps to make the model more robust to noise in the input data.

### Model
The ResNet VGG16 model is a deep convolutional neural network that has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. This means that the model has already learned to identify a variety of objects, including faces.

We can use the ResNet VGG16 model as a starting point for our facial recognition system. We can fine-tune the model by training it on our own dataset of images.

### Training
To train the model, we need to provide it with the training data and the labels. The labels are the names of the people in the images.

The model will learn to associate the labels with the features of the faces in the images. Once the model has been trained, it can be used to identify faces in new images.

### Evaluation
Once the model has been trained, we need to evaluate its performance. We can do this by using the test set.

The test set should not be used to train the model. It should only be used to evaluate the model's performance.

We can evaluate the model's performance by calculating the accuracy, precision, and recall. Accuracy is the percentage of images that the model correctly identifies. Precision is the percentage of images that the model correctly identifies as belonging to a particular person. Recall is the percentage of images that the model correctly identifies as belonging to a particular person, out of all the images that belong to that person.
